# ALU

In Gowin FPGA logic tiles, it is possible to configure a CLS (slice of two LUTs) in ALU mode. In this mode a hard logic carry chain is used in combination with programmable logic to implement fast arithmetic.

ALU mode is available on the 3 CLS in each tile that have a flip-flop and LUT. One fuse selects whether the `F` LUT output will pass through the ALU. Hard carry logic runs from west to east from LUT0 to LUT5 across tiles.

In chip series up to GW5A, of both LUTs are switched to ALUs simultaneously, while in GW5A, each LUT has its own fuse. In addition, in the GW5A series, the very first ALU (with index 0) has a MUX at the CIN input, allowing the initial value of CIN to be set as a constant, COUT of the previous ALU, or a signal from the logic.

Signal formation in logic is still in questionâ€”no matter how hard I tried, the vendor IDE did not use this mechanism, but added an auxiliary ALU in front that formed CARRY. We do the same.

The ALU hard logic takes the shape of a full adder, where the carry chain is fully hard logic, and the first `XOR` gate is formed by the `LUT4`. But the lower 4 bits are shared with an additional `LUT2` which mostly acts as an input selector between `A` and `B` in front of the carry `AND`. The `C` input is mostly wired to `1` so the main `LUT4` doesn't use the lower bits, but in one case `C=0` and `D=1` to much the same effect.

On the synthesis side, the ALU primitive supports 9 modes, wich correspond to a bit pattern stored in the LUT, as well as which ports are used, and which are set to constant values.

These values should be understood as follows: The lowest 4 bits are shared between the `LUT4` in the carry "selector" `LUT2`, so in the case of `ADD` `1010`, selecting `A`. In almost all cases `C:1` which means the output of the `LUT4` is controlled by `AAAA0000AAAA0000` avoiding the lower bits and explainging the zeros in most modes. In the case of `ADD` the `LUT4` function is therefore `01100110`, which is `A XOR B`. In the case of `MUL` `C:0` and `D:1` so indeed only `0000AAAA00000000` is used for the `LUT4`, having the function of `AND`, like the lower `LUT2`. I have confirmed the funcionality is identical with the other clusters set to `0000`. The full list of implemented logic functions:

```
FN         LUT4             LUT2
ADD(0)     A XOR B          A
SUB(1)     !A XOR B         A
ADDSUB(2)  A XOR B XOR !D   A
NE(3)      A XOR B          1
GE/LE(4-5) A XOR B          A
CUP(6)     A                0
CDN(7)     !A               1
CUPCDN(8)  A XNOR D         A
MUL(9)     A AND B          A AND B
```

It seems counterintuitive that the `LUT2` has an asymetric function, but it all works out in the end. See for yourself.

Armed with this knowledge, we can puzzle out what the total function of each `ALU` mode is. Most of them have obvious names with well known truth tables, but `MUL` is a strange one. When we find its total function analytically or experimentally, we find that it computes `A*B+CI`, in other words, an `AND` into a half adder. Our theory is that this could be used in implementing a Wallace tree or other long multiplication algorithm.

As a challenge, I decided to try a full adder that computes `A*B+D+CI`. To implement this the `LUT4` function should be `(A AND B) XOR D` and the `LUT2` function `A AND B`, giving the total data `0111000010001000` which indeed works as expected for `C=1`. This is compatible with the Gowin `MUL` if it were configured with `C=1` and `D=I3` instead of `C=0` and `D=1`.
