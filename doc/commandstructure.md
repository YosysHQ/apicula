# Command structure

## Config Frames

`0x3B` looks like the “load config” command (similar to `LSC_PROG_INCR_RTI` for ECP5)
`0x80` CRC enable
`0x02` number of frames MSB
`0xC8` number of frames LSB

Followed by configuration frames (including EBR) (`0x2C8`=712) of them in this case, gw1nr9)

Each frame seems to be:
    1. Frame data, with 1s appended at the start to make it an multiple of 8 bits (guess, similar to ECP5)
    2. CRC-16 that matches “CRC-16/ARC” algorithm at https://crccalc.com/ but endian swapped (optional)
    3. 6x `0xFF` bytes

At end of bitstream 18 more `0xFF` bytes followed by 2 bytes `0x34` `0x73` which are the CRC as above of the last 24 `0xFF` bytes

First CRC is special, like ECP5, as it also covers the commands after the preamble except the flash address.

## Preamble

20 `0xFF` bytes, followed by two bytes “file checksum” (for early Vendor tool release), followed by `0xFF` `0xFF` `0xA5` `0xC3`
For comparison ECP5 preamble is `0xFF` `0xFF` `0xBD` `0xB3`
“File checksum” matches value displayed in programmer, unlikely actually used by hardware

## Slots
Slots (the name was chosen for lack of a better term) are single cells located outside the main grid. They are designed to accommodate fuses for a single functional block, such as a PLL.

The slots have the same height of 8 rows and different widths. There is no geometric reference to the main grid or to each other, but there is a unique number that defines the function of the slot - for example, slot number 8 is intended for the lowest PLL.     

Slots that are not used in a particular design are simply not included in the output file.

Slot commands:

`0x6a` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `slot_index` - beginning of the slot description with the `slot_index` index, a special case when `slot_index=0xff` is specified - this is the beginning of the slot block if the  slots were included in the design at all.

`0x6d` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` + 16 bytes of `0xff` - unknown.

`0x6b` `0x80` `0x00` + `slot_size` - size in bytes, actually the width of the slot since the height is always equal to 8. This is followed by the slot content bytes, followed by two CRC bytes and 16 bytes of `0xff`.

`0x68` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` - end of the slot block

## Other commands

Command always followed by 3 “option” bytes, usually `0x00` except for “load config”, like ECP5 commands

`0x06` (or `0x86` when `bit_crc_check` not set) IDCODE check (similar to ECP5 `VERIFY_ID`)
Followed by 3x `0x00` bytes

Then the JTAG IDCODE
For GW1N-1: IDCODE `0x0900281B`; bytes here `0x09` `0x00` `0x28` `0x1B`
For GW1NR-9: IDCODE `0x1100581B`; bytes here `0x11` `0x00` `0x58` `0x1B`
For GW2AR-18: IDCODE `0x0000081B`; bytes here `0x00` `0x00` `0x08` `0x1B`


`0x10` (or `0x90` when `bit_crc_check` not set)
- [56:24]: unknown `0x00000000` (seems to be same for all devices and configs)
- [23:16]: value depending on `loading_rate` (value to determine) (or 0x00 when N/A)
- [15:14]: unknown `0x0`
- [13]   : `1` when `bit_compress` set
- [12]   : `1` when `program_done_bypass` set
- [11:0] : unknown `0x000`

`0x51` (or `0xD1` when `bit_crc_check` not set) Compress configuration
 - [56:24] : unknown `0x00FFFFFF` (seems to be same for all devices and configs)
 - [23:16] : `OxFF` for uncompressed bitstream or a value used to replace 8x `0x00` in compress mode
 - [15:8]  : `OxFF` for uncompressed bitstream or a value used to replace 4x `0x00` in compress mode
 - [7:0]   : `OxFF` for uncompressed bitstream or a value used to replace 2x `0x00` in compress mode

`0x0B` (or `0x8B` when `bit_crc_check` not set) only present when `bit_security` is set
Followed by 3x `0x00` bytes

`0xD2` Set SPI flash address (8 bytes)
 - [56:32]: unknown, always `0x00FFFF`
 - [31:0] : SPI flash address (or `0x00000000` if N/A)

`0x12` (or `0x92` when `bit_crc_check` not set) Unknown `0x000000`

Last command before `0x3B` (or `0xBB` when `bit_crc_check` not set) config frame load command, probably equiv to `LSC_INIT_ADDRESS`
- [23]   : `1` when `bit_crc_check` set
- [22:16]: unknown, always `0x00`
- [15:0] : number of lines in configuration data section

`0x0A` set USERCODE (similar to `ISC_PROGRAM_USERCODE`)
Followed by 3x `0x00` bytes
Then the 4-byte USERCODE

`0x08` final command in bitstream, probably equivalent to ECP5 `ISC_PROGRAM_DONE`
Followed by 3x `0x00` bytes

`0xFF` NOP/padding
