Long wires are used for fast fanout signals. The receivers can be either CLK, CE, SR or LUT inputs. 

You can figure out a lot already from the syntax of the CLOCK_LOC constraint:
 
 CLOCK_LOC "net-name" clocks=fanout [quadrant]

 clocks:
 - BUFG[0-7]  eight master clocks
 - BUFS[0-7]  eight long lines
 - LOCAL_CLOCK "not to route clock line" (???)

 fanout:
 - CLK
 - CE
 - SR set/reset/clear/preset
 - LOGIC jther than the above
 the | can be used as OR.

 So we have 8 long wires per quandrant, which btw can be set as LEFT (L), RIGHT (R) for GW1N series and as TOPLEFT (TL), TOPRIGHT (TR), BOTTOMLEFT (BT) and BOTTOMRIGHT (BR) for GW1N-9/GW1NR-9/GW1N-9C/GW1NR-9C, GW2A series.

Specifying a limit does not mean that the vendor P&R will necessarily involve a long wire. You need to play around with the number of consumers and the type of sockets. The minimum set can be represented as:
```
    name = "r_src"
    dff = codegen.Primitive("DFF", name)
    dff.portmap['CLK'] = "w_clk"
    dff.portmap['D'] = "w_dummy"
    dff.portmap['Q'] = "w_lw"
    mod.wires.update({"w_dummy", "w_lw"})
    mod.primitives[name] = dff
    cst.clocks["w_lw"] = "BUFS[5]=LOGIC"
    cst.cells[name] = "R8C12[0][A]"
    # dest ff0
    name = "r_dst0"
    dff = codegen.Primitive("DFF", name)
    dff.portmap['CLK'] = "w_clk"
    dff.portmap['D'] = "w_lw"
    dff.portmap['Q'] = "w_dst2_d"
    mod.wires.update({"w_dst2_d"})
    mod.primitives[name] = dff
    cst.cells[name] = "R2C2[0][B]"
    # dest ff2
    name = "r_dst2"
    dff = codegen.Primitive("DFFS", name)
    dff.portmap['CLK'] = "w_clk"
    dff.portmap['D'] = "w_lw"
    dff.portmap['Q'] = "w_led"
    dff.portmap['SET'] = "w_dst2_d"
    mod.primitives[name] = dff
    cst.cells[name] = "R3C3[0][B]"
```

# A
Here the long wires LW[0-7] are connected to the SS00 and SS40 buses of the left and right quadrants. The corresponding fuses must be reset to 0 in order to connect the long wire to the bus.
There is no choice to which bus (SS00 or SS40), only connect/disconnect.

The buses consist of spines that are different for the right and left quadrant.

# B
Connecting the spines with the vertical wires. Here shown is the vertical wire from the `SS40` bus, which is not drawn in the picture of the whole chip because it would result in a mess, but these hidden wires go in pairs with the drawn wires from the `SS00` bus.

Only one spine from each tire is connected, which one is determined from the column of the cell using the table:

| Col mod 4 | SS00 spine | SS40 spine |
|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|     0     |     1      |      5     |   
|     1     |     0      |      4     |   
|     2     |     3      |      7     |   
|     3     |     2      |      6     |   

What the `A6`, `A7`, `B6`, `B7`, `F6`, `F7` inputs are is still unclear.
It is interesting that it is possible to connect the same spine to `LT02` and `LT13`.

# C
Here the vertical taps `LT01` and `LT04` are connected to the horizontal branches `LBO0` and `LBO1`.
As usual the column determines which long wire the branch is connected to, to some extent --- we remember that not only the buses are connected to the taps, but also half a dozen other unknown sources.

And one more thing: the taps are not named `LT02` and `LT13`, which suggests that there is some other mechanism here.

The two cells in the center of the chip with types 81 and 82 are responsible for sources for long wires. Here I also add two adjacent cells with types 83 and 84. 83 contains 7 muxes for lines 40--46 and 84 contains a mux for line 47.

These lines 40--47 are connected to buses `SS00` and `SS40` in the bottom row of the chip. But so far I can't get the vendor IDE to use them so their purpose is unclear.

The `+` marked sources whose locations are known and I will explain how to find them.

The `dat` dictionary has a table `UfbIns`, whose entries have the structure `[row number, column number, pip code]`. Thus the entry `[4, 1, 126]` means that CLK2 pip in cell [4, 1] is an entry point to somewhere.
Experimentally it is found that CLK2 are the entry points to the long wire system and it is these points that are marked with a `+` sign in the table above.

The record number in the table `UfbIns` is as the code from the table above minus 104. 

# F
This cell contains a connection to the `SS00` and `SS40` buses of some obscure wires. They cannot be made to be used even if you place all the primitives literally next to the bottom row - the buses in the top row will still be used.
